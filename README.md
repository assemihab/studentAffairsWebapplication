studentAffairs web application
This project consists of 15 web pages. The technologies used in this project are Django framework, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The first page has only one working link, which is the second link (click on Student Affairs). I created it as specified in the assignment description.

The second page is just a home page. We used some pictures from the internet for Coventry University and used lorem ipsum to describe the pictures.
